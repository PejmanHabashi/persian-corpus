# Introduction

This repository will contain continuation of UPPSALA Persian Corpus. Which itself is a continuation of Bijan Khan Corpus. The idea here is for community to improve the corpus by finding mistakes and fixing them. 

# Fixes Applied

A set of fixes has been already applied to the corpus:"
  - Sometimes, "ث" has been used instead of "ه‌ی" at the end of the word (Note there is ZWNJ character between two characters). Like "دایرث" insted od "دایره‌ی". (potentially few still remains)
  - Few tags where missing which added.
  

# TODO
There are few thing that has not been fixed yet.
  - We do have "دایرةالمعارف" and "دائرةالمعارف". Which one we should keep? These words refere to the same concept. We should have a standard correct version and keep that one only.
